# Encoder/Motor/Gear Box 

The aim of this project is to develop a 3D-printed very low cost gear box for playing with robotics. It should 
cost less than $10 to make, yet include absolute positioning (meaning you can command the "servo" to move to any 
angle you choose) as well as continuous rotation with speed control and odometry. It should have a built-in 
motor controller and be simple to control from a microcontroller with I2C.
